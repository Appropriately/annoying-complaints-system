# annoying-complaints-system
## What is this?
An complaint system with login functionality, built using an AngularJS frontend and a Flask
backend. It is designed to make the user even more angry, and we achieve this using a variety of
means.

## Why would you do this?
We did this as part of HackManchester 2017 for the Ombudsman challenge - which coincidentally 
was to produce a complaint system that makes a user even angrier.

## What does it do?

* Analyses text to produce the positive version of a complaint
* Asks unnecessary questions
* Works as a fully functional complaints system
* Custom captcha for added inconvenience
